# Two-Step Q-Learning

This repository contains the Python files to reproduce the results from the paper titled "Two-Step Q-learning". 

## Maximization Example


The first example is analogous to the classic maximization example provided in the book - Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (Chapter 6, Example 6.1). 

The directory Max_Bias has all the files required to run the algorithms and, consequently, files to compare the algorithms with plots. 

## Roulette as multi-armed bandit Example

The second example is a classic roulette problem expressed as a single-state multi-armed bandit problem. Once again, the directory roulette has all the files required to run the algorithms and plot the graphs. 






### Acknowledgments

The Max_Bias example and Roulette as multi-armed bandit example are based on and adapted from [The-Mean-Squared-Error-of-Double-Q-Learning](https://github.com/wentaoweng/The-Mean-Squared-Error-of-Double-Q-Learning).
